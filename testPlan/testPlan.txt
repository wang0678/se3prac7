Test Plan for Game2048

This test plan is used to fully test the Game2048 software that developed for Practise 3 and 4.

Test cases

1: Validate Game2048 can display properly with 4*4 grid, initialised with 2 numbers 2 or 4 in a random position.
    1.1: To check Game2048 display 4 rows and 4 columns.
	1.2: To check Game2048 display 2 numbers when game starts, e.g (2, 2 or 2, 4) at random positions in the board.
    
2: Validate Game2048 can react to all the supported key actions as specified by the specification in practise 3&4.
    2.1: To press left arrow key to check whether the board tilts all the numbers to the left.
	2.2: To press right arrow key to check whether the board tilts all the number to the right.
	2.3: To press up arrow key to check whether the board tilts all the number to the upside.
    2.4: To press down arrow key to check whether the board tilts all the number to the down side.
	2.5: To press ESC key to check whether the Game2048 reset to start status.
    2.6: To press an invalid key to check whether the board reacts nothing or not. 	

3: Validate Game2048 can tilt all numbers to one direction if one particular direction arrow key is pressed.
    3.1: To press left arrow key to check whether the board tilts all numbers to left side.
    3.2: To press right arrow key to check whether the board tilts all number to right side.
    3.3: To press up arrow key to check whether the board tilts all the numbers to upside.
    3.4: To press down arrow key to check whether the board tilts all the numbers to down side.	
	3.5: To create a scenario that 4 numbers(no same numbers at two continuous cells) in one line or column stays same when either left/right or up/down key pressed.
	
4: Validate Game2048 can merge same number correctly in one direction for one row.
    4.1: To press one of the arrow key to check one row/column (if there are numbers e.g: 2,2,0,0 in one row/column), it should be 4,0,0,0 after tilt.
	4.2: To press one of the arrow key to check one row/column (if there are two numbers e.g: 2,4 in one row/column), it should be still keep 2, 4.
	4.3: To press one of the arrow key to check one row/column (if there are numbers e.g: 2,2,4,0 in one row/column), it should be 4,4,0 after tilt.
	4.4: To press one of the arrow key to check one row/column (if there are numbers e.g: 2,4,2,4 in one row/column), it should be 2,4,2,4 after tilt.
	4.5: To press one of the arrow key to check one row/column (if there are numbers e.g: 2,2,2,2 in one row/column), it should be 4,4,0,0 after tilt.

5: Validate Game2048 can tilt/merge numbers correctly in all directions (iterate for left, up, right, down separately)
    5.1: To press left arrow key to check the board, it should tilt and merge all numbers to left side.
    5.2: To press right arrow key to check the board, it should tilt and merge all numbers to right side.
    5.3: To press up arrow key to check the board, it should tilt and merge all numbers to upside.
    5.4: To press down arrow key to check the board, it should tilt and merge all numbers to downside.

6ï¼šValidate Game2048 can add a new number when numbers on the board actually changed (moved or merged).
    6.1: To press left arrow key to check all number should moved/merged to left side, and a number (2 or 4) should be filled in a random empty cells.
	6.2: To press right arrow key to check all number should moved/merged to right side, and a number (2 or 4) should be filled in a random empty cells.
 	6.3: To press up arrow key to check all number should moved/merged to up side, and a number (2 or 4) should be filled in a random empty cells.
	6.4: To press down arrow key to check all number should moved/merged to down side, and a number (2 or 4) should be filled in a random empty cells.
	6.5: To create a scenario that no numbers will be moved/merged to one of the directions. To check no new number should be filled in empty cells.
	
7: Validate Game2048 can behave correctly when board filled with numbers.
    7.1: To create a scenario that the board filled with numbers but still can merge in one direction(e.g. up/down). Game should not be in failure state.
    7.2: To create the above scenario and press up/down key to check the board should tilt the board to either direction with same number in adjacent cells merged.
    7.3: To create a scenario that the board filled with numbers but not be able to merge in any of the directions. Press any key, it should report failure game status.

8: Validate Game2048 can calculate score correctly.
    8.1: To check the score displayed should be the sum of all merged numbers on the board.
	8.2: To create a scenario that the score can reach 2048, then it should change the game status to success. 

9: Validate Game2048 colour change when	tow numbers merge.
    9.1: To check each number should be displayed with a different colour.
